# Code-Generation-Targeting-LLVM-IR

A Lisp Based Programming Language is compiled and is represented using LLVM IR. I have used Bison and Lex to parse and scan the file respectively. 

## Programming Rules 

| Rules | Explanation |
| ----  | ----- | 
| (+ 1 2 ) | Add the operands and returns the result |
| (- 1 ) | Negates the operand |
| (* 1 2 ) | Returns the product of the operands |
| (/ 5 2) | Returns the Quotient of the operands |
